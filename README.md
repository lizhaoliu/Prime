Prime
=====
Prime is a physically based renderer built on pure Java. It is capable of utilizing the following algorithms for the job:
  1. Monte Carlo ray tracing.
  2. Photon Mapping

Prime is able to adopt multiple processor cores to render in parallel and can be easily deployed on clusters to perform distributed rendering.

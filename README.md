Prime
=====
Prime is a physically based renderer built on pure Java, featuring:
  1. Monte Carlo ray tracing.
  2. Photon Mapping.
  3. Metropolis sampling.

Prime is able to adopt all processor cores to render in parallel and can be easily deployed on multiple clusters to perform distributed rendering.

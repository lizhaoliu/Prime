Prime is a physically based renderer built on pure Java with JOGL binding, featuring:
  1. Monte Carlo ray tracing.
  2. Photon Mapping.
  3. Distributed Rendering.

Prime is able to adopt all processor cores to render in parallel and can be easily deployed on multiple clusters to perform distributed rendering.

//! # prime-core
//!
//! A headless, physically based path tracer. This crate is a pure rendering
//! library — it has **no** windowing, OpenGL, or image-codec dependencies — so
//! it builds and tests anywhere and can be driven by any front-end (the
//! `prime` CLI, a test harness, a future GUI, …).
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! A [`scene::Scene`] bundles a material table, a [`bvh::Bvh`] of
//! [`geometry::Primitive`]s, a [`camera::CameraConfig`], and a
//! [`scene::Background`]. It is handed to [`integrator::render`], which
//! path-traces it in parallel into a [`framebuffer::Framebuffer`] of linear HDR
//! color. The framebuffer resolves to 8-bit sRGB via [`color`].
//!
//! Build a scene programmatically (see [`demo`]) or describe it as data with
//! [`desc::SceneDesc`] (RON, replacing the legacy Java-serialization format).

/// The scalar type used throughout the renderer. Aliased so precision is a
/// single edit; `f32` keeps geometry compact and intersection fast.
pub type Float = f32;

/// Linear RGB color is represented with the same value type as a vector.
pub type Color = math::Vec3;

/// Index into a [`scene::Scene`]'s material table.
pub type MaterialId = usize;
